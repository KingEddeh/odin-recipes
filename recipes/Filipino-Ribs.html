    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Spareribs glazed with the sweet, tangy taste of the Philippines. One of the honey coating ingredients, star anise, is native to China; it is a star-shaped, dark brown pod that contains a pea-sized seed in each of its eight segments. Star anise is available at all Asian markets as well as many general grocery stores.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li></li>
        <li>6 pounds pork spareribs</li>
        <li>2 medium onions, cut into wedges</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons soy sauce, divided</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>6 whole star anise pods</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>½ cup honey</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place ribs in a large stock pot with the 2 wedged onions, 4 tablespoons of soy sauce, pepper, and star anise pods. Add water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low, cover, and let simmer in meat juices until ribs are tender when pierced, about 1 ¼ hours. Stir occasionally.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add remaining chopped onion and sauté, stirring often, until onion is soft. Blend in the ginger, honey, sugar, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, and remaining 2 tablespoons of soy sauce. Cook all together, stirring, until well blended. Remove from heat./li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Using tongs, remove ribs from the stock pot and arrange in a single layer in an 11x16-inch baking dish. Brush evenly with honey mixture and bake in the preheated oven, basting often with pan drippings, about 30 minutes or until ribs are well glazed.</li>
    </ol>
